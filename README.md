# hello-world
Hi there,
I'm just starting to learn this hoping to develop some skills in the area of Data Science.
Hope things get clearer as I get on. 1 Corinthians 13:12 - For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part; then I shall know fully, even as I have been fully known.
Thanks
